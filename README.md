# üåê Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository the deployed site can be viewed at https://jspalms.github.io/. I'm basically going to be using it as a notebook for things that I've learnt, useful resources and a place to organise my thoughts.

## üìÑ This project

This will probably be the 5th attempted "Blog" which I've written, most of them fall by the wayside while I try and over engineer the site itself so this time I'm just using an astro template and focusing on the content

The template for this project was made by [sorollaportfolio](https://github.com/jramma/sorollaportfolio.git) under the [MIT License](LICENSE). Originally built for server rendering using netlify I'm hosting using github pages and pre-building the whole thing
