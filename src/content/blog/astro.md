There are so many static site generators out there that I wasn't sure which one to go for. Ultimately there are a number of factors

1. Ease of setup - this is just going to be for taking notes so the site doesn't have to be a project in itself
2. Familiarity - I didn't want to have to learn a whole new tech stack
3. Performance - Its a static site so its going to be performant anyway but thats what they all bang on about anyway

## Different options

## Why Astro

### Island Architecture

The big selling point of Astro is its island architecture: the majority of a page is static HTML generated at build time, making it fast and lightweight. For areas that require interactivity — like a button with an onClick handler or a component that updates based on an API response — Astro ships only the necessary JavaScript for those parts. These interactive components are called islands and are hydrated on the client individually, rather than sending a full JS bundle.

This is different from traditional Single Page Applications (SPAs), where the entire page structure and UI are generated by JavaScript on the client, even if it's just rendering static content. As a result, SPAs often ship large JavaScript bundles, including code that's only needed for rendering components, even though that rendering could have been done on the server or at build time. This can lead to slower initial page loads and higher JS costs for users.

Even many SSR frameworks (like next.js) will render the HTML on the server but still send the Javascript used for rendering to the client for hydration even if its not really doing much when it gets there. In Astro, you instead opt into interactivity explicitly, giving you much more control over what JavaScript is actually shipped.

- whats and asto component

By default astro strips all the JS out of a component before sending it to the client to keep it stripped down. You need to opt into sending JS using a client directive

<MyReactComponent client:load />

- You can use SSR but you need to turn it on and you need and adapter- when should you do this

### Templates

### Content

Very easy to use MD or MDX

### Any UI Framework

I only really know react but if I wanted to make a Svelte component then I can sprinkle them in too. It doesn't really care which one you use to build components.

The unique element in Astro are [Astro components](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/). These have all the JS stripped out before sending to the client weirdly you can include client side JS if you add a script tag but this seems a bit odd "whoa specific no JS components... but you can add JS". In general I think that they can be coersed to feel more like react components but thats not the normal approach they are like HTML-first with optional JS sprinkles, React is like JS-first, with optional server-side rendering

Astro assumes components are purely presentational HTML, and leaves out all JavaScript unless you opt-in.
In contrast, React assumes everything is dynamic and ships JavaScript for every component.
